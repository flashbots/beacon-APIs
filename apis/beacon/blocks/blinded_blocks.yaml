  summary: "Publish a signed blinded block."
  operationId: "publishBlindedBlock"
  description: |
    Instructs the beacon node to broadcast a newly signed blinded beacon block to the MEV-Boost,
    to be included in the beacon chain. The beacon node is not required to validate the signed
    `BlindedBeaconBlock`, and a successful response (20X) only indicates that the broadcast has been
    successful. The beacon node is expected to integrate the new block into its state, and
    therefore validate the block internally, however blocks which fail the validation are still
    broadcast but a different status code is returned (202)
